Data acquired from the Arduino Nano 33 BLE sensors

Columns:
  Millis: Number of milliseconds ellapsed since the Arduino was powered on
  Sensor: Sensor type: A (Accelerometer), M (Magnetometer), G (Gyroscope)
  X: X component of the sensor reading
  Y: Y component of the sensor reading
  Z: Z component of the sensor reading

The Magnetoscope has a lower acquisition frequency than the other two sensors, so there are less readings of this sensor in the data.
  
The data was acquired placing the arduino Nano in the lateral of the washing machine with a double sided tape.

The machine ran with water but without clothes. Another data acquisition with clothes must be performed.
